His most complex project involved building WCAG-compliant real-time collaboration tools across three products with WebSocket integration and Spring Boot + Kotlin backend.",
    "performance": "Performance is core to Hareesh's approach as a Senior Engineer. He's reduced client-side complexity by 40%, improved load times by 70%, and optimized Google Maps API calculations from 7 to 3 seconds using Web Workers. He focuses on critical path rendering and efficient state management.",
    "accessibility": "Hareesh ensures all interfaces meet WCAG AA standards. He developed and launched WCAG-compliant real-time collaboration tools across three products, implementing proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support. Accessibility isn't optionalâ€”it's fundamental.",
    "proud": "Hareesh is most proud of the real-time collaboration tools he built at Group 1001. The system enables teams to communicate asynchronously within applications, reducing reliance on external channels and improving team productivity through WebSocket-powered real-time features."
